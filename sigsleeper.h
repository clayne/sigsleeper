 * Lessons in understanding low-level userspace code: Occasionally the man pages will lie to you.

 * There is actually a *fourth* arg to sigaction. Check out: sys_rt_sigaction in linux/kernel/signal.c
 * Since glibc uses _NSIG/8 for this value, we will too, though it feels like a dirty hack. Both glibc and the kernel
 * source that reference this arg are preceded by triple-X comments. (In defense of glibc and the kernel, if feels 
 * like a legacy segment where Linus' "DON'T BREAK USERSPACE!" rule has run headlong into glibc's quest to offer a 
 * standardized posix interface to the kernel. Both of these are good things. Legacy just happens sometimes.)
 *
 * As a general rule though, if the results from your code are contradicting the documentation, go and read the source.
 * (And I don't mean the comments from the source. Those can help to find your way around, but they can also lie. The
 * code, however, cannot.)
